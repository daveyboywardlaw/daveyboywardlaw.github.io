## Overview

This blog will talk about why saying "Testers break things" can be harmful to testers and can lead to a perception that testers and the skill of testing are not as respected as they should be. 

## Frustration

 One phrase that infuriates me in the testing and quality world is "Testers just break things". It may may take others forms such as: 

	- "You're a tester, your job is to break things"

	- "All you testers do is break things"

	- "Try and do your best to break It"


It may sometimes seem a little jokey or said in jest, but ultimately is can have negative connotations to the tester, testers and testing as a whole. Just the word break elacites negative things. As a child you would have probably got told off if you broke something. I know I did and I would do anything to cover it up. I once kick a football in the garden and broke a branch of an expensive bush/tree thing that they had bought. I know I would get told off because I "broke it" so I used sellotape to fix it !!!! 

Negative connotations about someones role, task or job can have a negative impact in many ways. Below are some examples and how they could relate to testing:

### Psychological Well-being
If a tester hears that all they do is break things then it could result in a demineished sense of self worth as well as more serious things such as anxiety and depression when individuals internlise negative self perceptions

### Discrimination:
Negative connotations can contribute testers potentially be deswcriminated against and have a sense of diminished value as all they do is "break things"

### Opinion Formation:
If testing is seen as breaking things and unfavourable, the connotation can make people have negative opinions about testing as a whole and individuals that test. Others may feel that all testers can do is break things and nothing else.

### Creates Tension:
Negative connotations could make communication tense when a tester needs to communicate some negative news. They may not communicate at all or gloss over it as they may feel they will just get told "Oh you always break it".

Now some people lean into this persona of breaking things and thatâ€™s OK, providing you are happy with that. However, if you are not if can impact how you feel as well as how others perceive you. Now some of these may seem a little extreme but they can happen. If people keep saying things enough you can start to believe it. A lot of people just want to do a good job and feel like they add value and these negative connotations can have that impact. 


### What do I mean by a break

A break in software is something that results in unintended behaviour that has  a negative impact to the user.

### You broke it!!! No I didn't

When is something broken? Lets take a children's toy. Its usually pretty obvious when it is broken, If you have a toy car and it is missing a wheel then it is clear that it is broken. Now it may be that you cannot see that it is broken, for example, the wheel could be hanging by a thread and looks OK. Its only when you start using it do you realise that it is broken. Most of the time though it will be obvious and most breaks will easily be seen. 

Software is different, it is always going to be broken. THere will always be some part of the system that has an issue that has not been found yet. It may be obvious but it may not be. The issues can be very subtle and very hard replicate but in all software there will be issues. So when someone says a tester just break things they are wrong, the software is already broken. What the tester has done is uncover that the software is broken. 

### ???

The key skill of a tester is knowing where to look for thise breaks and understand how best to test the software in order to uncover them. Thats a skill that requires years of proactoce to hone and develop. By saying oh testers just break something diminishes the skills good testers have and ignore the value work that they contribute to a successful product or project. 

### What can we do to change it

There are a couple of ways:

 - Oh, stop saying I break things, I do more than that !!!!
	Yes that is one way but probably not the best way as it could damage relationships

 - SHow the results of what you do 
	Show how you found the bug and what your thought process was as you were testing. THis will show the skill that you have and that there is more to testing that just breaking it
